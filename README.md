# aws-ecs-ha-app

This is a repository for my personal project of setting up a high availability application on AWS ECS Fargate.

The application I will be using is a RESTful API boilerplate written in Golang. I did not create this. [Here is the link to the repository.](https://github.com/qiangxue/go-restful-api)

A rough diagram of the infrastructure is below.
